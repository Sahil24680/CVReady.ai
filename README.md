# 📚 AI Resume Coach & Big‑Tech Readiness Dashboard

*A full‑stack **Next.js 14 (App Router)** + **Django 4 (REST)** project that scores résumés like a Big‑Tech recruiter and tracks student progress.*

| Layer    | Tech |
|----------|------|
| Frontend | Next 14 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Supabase Auth |
| Backend  | Django 4 · Django REST Framework |
| Database | PostgreSQL (via Supabase) |
| AI       | OpenAI GPT‑4 |
| DevOps   | ESLint · Prettier · Jest · GitHub Actions CI |

## ✨ What it does

⚙️ Powered by **OpenAI GPT-4**, the system analyzes key résumé traits Big Tech recruiters care about:
- Technical depth (system design, DSA)
- Project scope and ownership
- Clarity of impact and writing


1. **Résumé Upload** – drag‑and‑drop PDF/DOCX.  
2. **AI Analysis** – GPT‑4 returns Big‑Tech readiness + résumé‑clarity scores.  
3. **Storage** – feedback saved in Postgres (Supabase).  



I built this to sharpen Next.js + Django skills while mentoring freshmen who asked:  
*“How do I tweak my résumé for Google or Meta?”*

## 🚀 Quick start (local)

```bash
git clone <repo>.git && cd <repo>

# env templates
cp backend/.env.example  backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
# add OPENAI_API_KEY, Supabase URL & anon key, DATABASE_URL, etc.

# backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver          # http://localhost:8000

# frontend (new terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev                         # http://localhost:3000

## 🧰 Common scripts

| Layer | Command | Task |
|-------|---------|------|
| Frontend | `npm run dev` / `build` / `start` | dev / prod build / run |
|          | `npm run lint` / `test`          | ESLint + Prettier / Jest |
| Backend  | `python manage.py test`          | DRF endpoint tests |
|          | `ruff check .`                   | fast Python linter |
| Root CI  | GitHub Actions                   | lint + tests on every PR |

---
In addition to manual testing during development, I added a few non-critical automated tests using **Jest** (frontend) and **Django's built-in test framework** (backend).  
The goal wasn’t full coverage — it was to **learn how modern testing workflows function** and get hands-on with test setup, structure, and syntax in both ecosystems.


## 🔑 Environment variables

| File | Key | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| `backend/.env`          | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` |
| `frontend/.env.local`   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` |

> **Secrets stay local** (git‑ignored); only `.env.example` templates are committed.

## 🎓 Motivation

When I started mentoring incoming CS students, one question kept coming up again and again:

> *“How do I get into Google or Meta?”*  
> *“Is my résumé good enough for Big Tech?”*

I saw how worried they were — especially early in college — about whether they had what it takes to stand out. These same questions dominate Discord chats, search trends, and forums like r/cscareerquestions.

I’ve been there too. So I thought:  
**Why not build a tool that does what a Big Tech recruiter would do — and explains why?**  
I’m an engineer, after all.

This project became a way for me to give back to my fellow students while leveling up my own full‑stack skills. It also gave me a chance to explore automated testing using **Jest** and **Django’s test runner** — something I had only heard of before.







Use the following as mterics alter when publish app 
| Resume Type | Old Cost (\$) | New Cost (\$) | Savings (\$) | Savings (%) |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Strong**  | 0.0218        | 0.0112        | 0.0105       | **48.5%**   |
| **Average** | 0.0265        | 0.0220        | 0.0045       | **17.0%**   |
| **Weak**    | 0.0300        | 0.0303        | -0.0003      | -1.0%       |

Key Takeaway:
Strong and average resumes — the most common case for returning users — see the biggest savings, while weaker resumes still get full-depth analysis. Over time, as users iterate and improve, the cost per analysis naturally drops.
